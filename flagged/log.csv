And also give me some of the precautionary measures for it.,"With what you're showing me, I think you have a case of Chicken pox, also known as Varicella. It's a highly contagious viral infection that causes a characteristic rash and fever. To prevent the spread of the virus, it's important to wash your hands frequently, avoid close contact with others, and avoid sharing personal items like towels and clothes. If you're already infected, it's essential to keep your skin clean and avoid scratching the affected area to prevent further irritation and infection. Taking antihistamines can help relieve itching and reduce swelling. Moreover, consuming fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C can support the healing process and boost immunity. Always consult a doctor for personalized advice and treatment.",,,,2025-04-04 17:00:48.467940
